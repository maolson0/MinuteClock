MinuteClock is a simple clock that tracks how much of the day has elapsed. There are three display tabs in the app. One shows the number of minutes elapsed since midnight. The second shows the number of seconds elapsed since midnight. The third shows the number of 100-microday units (a metric measure of time) have elapsed since midnight.

Each of these displays can, under the control of the iOS Preferences app settings for MinuteClock, count down instead. In that case, each shows the time remaining until midnight.

There are preference settings to control the color of the text displayed, and to keep the display live (it won't dim out and go blank) if you are using the MinuteClock as a desk clock.

This app was requested by a user of my MultiClock app. I enjoy measuring the time of day in different ways, and this seemed like a good addition to my stable of clocks.
